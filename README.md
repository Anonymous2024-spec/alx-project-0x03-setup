# Reactify TS: Mastering Advanced TypeScript in React

> A hands-on project for mastering **Advanced TypeScript** features in a **React** codebase. From utility types to generics, from type-safe hooks to complex props management — this repo is your guide to building robust, scalable React apps with confidence in TypeScript.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Demonstrate practical usage of advanced TypeScript types in React
- Build reusable and type-safe components, hooks, and contexts
- Explore patterns like Discriminated Unions, Generics, Conditional Types, Mapped Types, etc.
- Emphasize scalability, readability, and strong typing over time

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- ✅ Strict Prop Typing with Interfaces & Types
- ✅ Advanced `useReducer` Patterns with Type Safety
- ✅ Discriminated Union Props for Components
- ✅ Custom Hooks with Generic Parameters
- ✅ Type-safe Context API
- ✅ Utility Types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`, etc.)
- ✅ Module augmentation & ambient declarations
- ✅ Type-safe APIs and data fetching with `Zod`, `axios`, or `React Query`
- ✅ Component-level accessibility and semantic typing
